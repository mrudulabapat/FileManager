**Lite File Manager using Java Swing**

This project showcases a lite version of the classic Microsoft file manager, recreated using Java Swing. The application utilizes Java Swing's powerful components to create an intuitive split-panel interface, enhancing the user experience for file navigation and management. 

The main features of the project include:  

  **Split-Panel Interface**  
  The core of the lite file manager is its split-panel interface. The user interface is divided into two panels: the left panel displays folders in a tree-like 
  structure, while the right panel showcases files within the selected folder.  

  **Dynamic Expansion Mechanism with JTree**  
  The project effectively harnesses the inherent capabilities of Java Swing's JTree component to create a dynamic expansion mechanism. The JTree component 
  facilitates the display of hierarchical data in a tree-like structure. In this project, the JTree is utilized to represent the folder structure, allowing users to 
  expand and collapse directories as needed. This dynamic expansion mechanism offers a seamless navigation experience and improves the overall usability of the 
  application.  
  
  **Seamless Multi-Window Support**
  One of the highlights of the lite file manager is its ability to support multiple windows from multiple drives seamlessly. Users can open the files and also can  
  copy, delete and the rename the files as well.
